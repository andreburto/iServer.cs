Years ago I had this idea to build a web interface for iTunes using VB.NET so I
could control my music from anything. To that end I started looking for web
server code to learn from.

I found this: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/mywebserver.aspx

From it I developed this: http://pastebin.com/jG79DKPt

Recently I rewrote my VB.NET code into C# for another project I'm currently
developing. This project is that rewrite. This code has no license yet but is
freely available for anyone who wants to use it.
